# Single_Port_RAM
This Verilog module implements a single-port RAM (Random Access Memory) with configurable address width, data width, and depth. It allows for the storage and retrieval of data based on the input address. The module supports both read and write operations, controlled by the 'we' (Write Enable) signal. The module operates on a positive edge-triggered clock signal.
